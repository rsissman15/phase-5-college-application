## Requirements

- NodeJS (v16), and npm


See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.

## Setup

Start by **cloning** (not forking) the project template repository and removing
the remote:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:learn-co-curriculum/project-template-react-rails-api.git your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ git remote rm origin
```

Then, [create a new remote repository][create repo] on GitHub. Head to
[github.com](https://github.com) and click the **+** icon in the top-right
corner and follow the steps to create a new repository. **Important**: don't
check any of the options such as 'Add a README file', 'Add a .gitignore file',
etc â€” since you're importing an existing repository, creating any of those files
on GitHub will cause issues.

If you're working with a partner,
[add them as a collaborator][add collaborator] on GitHub. From your repo on
GitHub, go to Settings > Manage Access > Invite a collaborator and enter your
partner's username. Once your partner has access, they should git **clone** (not
fork) the repository.

[add collaborator]: https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository

Finally, connect the GitHub remote repository to your local repository and push
up your code:

```console
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-project-name.git
$ git push -u origin main
```


## How To Use

1. After you have cloned the repository, navigate into the client folder and install all dependencies from the frontend by running

`$npm start` (on [http://localhost:4000])
3. Open a new terminal tab and install all dependencies from the backend server by running

4. Run `rails db:create`, `rails db:migrate`, and `rails db:seed`
5. Start the backend server by running
 `$rails s`  (on [http://localhost:3000])
